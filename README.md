# HNoCS
## Synopsis 
BSc advanced project for implementing a speculative pipeline in HNoCs under the supervision of Yaniv Ben-Itzhak (PhD) - Technion, Israel.

## Summary
Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a new approach to design the communication subsystem of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and Chip-Multi-Processors (CMP). Supervised by Yaniv Ben-Itzhak (PhD)

NoC brings networking theories and systematic networking methods to on-chip communication and brings notable improvements over conventional bus systems. In this project, you will learn about NoC and particularly about different routing schemes used in NoC. You will write a simulation for those routing schemes over OMNeT++ (an event driven simulation platform that is used by many network and system simulation researchers) and will investigate their effect on NoC performance.
OMNeT++ is well known OMNeT++ is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework, primarily for building network simulators. OMNeT++ offers an Eclipse-based IDE, a graphical runtime environment, and a host of other tools.
OMNeT++ is a free academic version of OMNEST which is used by R&D staff, researchers and engineers worldwide to investigate various scenarios and design alternatives. OMNEST is used by: IBM, CISCO, QUALCOMM, Mellanox, Intel, HP, Alcatel-Lucent, BROADCOM, SUN, PHILIPS and more...
