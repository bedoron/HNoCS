The benchmarks is:
  BLACKSCHOLES from the PARSEC suite. 

The cache configuration is:
 64KB L1 and 4MB L2 caches, both with 64 bytes cache lines and 
 associativity of 64 lines per set.

Trace event format is as follows
<Time> <CoreID>/<ThreadID> <ReadWrite> <CacheInfo> <MemoryAddress> <OperandSize>
 
* <Time> is #cycles from the beginning.
* <CoreID> and <ThreadID> are as their name implies and the numbers are 0-based.
 In the simulated configuration(*), threads do not migrate between cores so you 
 may use either number to identify the thread. The numbers are not identical 
 due to the way the Simulator works but you can see that there are exactly 12 
 distinct pairs of <CoreID>/<ThreadID>.
* <ReadWrite> is either “R” or “W” for Read/Write, respectively.
* <CacheInfo> is “m” for cache miss (i.e. external memory access), “ph” for 
  private cache (L1) hit and “sh” for shared cache (L2) hit.
* <OperandSize> is the operand size in bytes. Note that the simulation is on 
  64-bit platform so 8 bytes operands are common.

(*) Application’s thread count does not exceed the number of thread context in 
    the architecture
