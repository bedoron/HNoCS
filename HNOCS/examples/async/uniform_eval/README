This demo show how many simulation can be run to evaluate a 4x4 Mesh 
that is using a asynchrounous router under uniform random destination traffic.  

The experiment uses a single packet size of 16flits and performs 10 
simulations on each offerred load. The average and maximal latency
as well as the average and minimal throughput (over all sinks) are measured.

NOTE: To produce the plots we simulate 100 cases (10 offered loads 10 random seeds each).

The asynchronous router is hierarchical and built out of input 
ports, output ports and VC and XY routing output port selectors.
The modules used are:
**.routerType = "nocs.routers.hier.idealRouter"
**.coreType   = "nocs.cores.NI"
**.sourceType = "nocs.cores.sources.PktFifoSrc"
**.sinkType   = "nocs.cores.sinks.InfiniteBWMultiVCSink"
**.portType   = "nocs.routers.hier.Port"
**.inPortType = "nocs.routers.hier.inPort.InPortAsync"
**.OPCalcType = "nocs.routers.hier.opCalc.static.XYOPCalc"
**.VCCalcType = "nocs.routers.hier.vcCalc.free.FLUVCCalc"
**.schedType  = "nocs.routers.hier.sched.wormhole.SchedAsync"
