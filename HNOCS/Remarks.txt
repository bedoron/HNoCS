BL_2:

1) should set the router control delay link not less than half clk and not more (include) than 1-clk of router link`s Capacity  

	to avoid the case when sending EoP+req for new SoP, when the req arrives too early (i.e. lower control delay) and there is free outVC, 
	the SoP will ger arbitration before EoP arrive to the sched.
	Can be solved by identify flows also by their inVC, check in arbitration if new req inVC is already getting service -> but perform HoL for other reqs ....

2) Max capacity (for now) is: 1e4 Gbps , should check again (2e4Gbps), VCcalc isnt used anymore... 


BL_2_async:

1) VC acquiring latency for 1st hop also includes part of queueing time: when SoP arrived to 1t inport -> sendReq -> 
   if EoP of prev packet hasn`t finished transmission, the gnt`s SoP will be delayed because of it. 
   Solution: 
   (a) move VC acquiring  to sched , if 1st sched: mask the latency of transmission of the same flow (only the same!)
   Notice that proper change is also required in Matlab ... 
   (b) modify source to hold SoP for the time between send EoP-1 to EoP, in such a way the artificial VC acquiring 
   latency will be moved to the queueing latency where it should be.. 

   On the other hand, it can be modeled by the VC acauiring queue model, in such a way that packet "sees" also its self 
   (i.e. previous packet of the same flow)
