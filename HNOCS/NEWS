Application concept introduced. This includes the following new files:
CMP.msg         - Defines Application messages that performs memory access.
App_Ifc.ned     - An application generating messages and connected to both a
                  source and a sink. Application messages are encapsulated and
                  de-encapsulataed by the approriate source and sink modules
cores/AppNI.ned - A type of network interface which encapsulates a vector
                  of applications connected through one source and one sink
                  to the NoC
cores/EchoApp.* - A simple application to test and demo how applications work
cores/CoreL1.*  - An application simulating a trivial processor and L1 core.
cores/L2.*      - An application simulating a trivial L2 cache.
cores/DRAM.*    - An application simulating a trivial DRAM controller.
sources/AppSrc.*- A source driven by a vector of applications. Provides 
                  arbitration, encapsulation and segmentation into FLITs.
sinks/AppSink.* - A packet sink providing reassembly, de-encapsulation and
                  completion of App messgaes from the NoC wire messages.
